# Recycle-Bin-implementation
The project is about how to implement recycle bin
This project implements a simple Recycle Bin system in Linux using Bash scripting.
Instead of permanently deleting files, this program moves them to a hidden directory (~/.recycle_bin) — just like how the Windows Recycle Bin works.

It’s a menu-driven shell program that lets you delete, restore, view, and permanently remove files safely from the command line.
